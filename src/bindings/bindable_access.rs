/// This trait indicates that a class is a wrapper of another widget that may have API you wish to access.
/// Used by BindingHost to "reach inside" things like LensWrapped in order to find the right widget to control,
/// given the bindings that it has.
///
/// Widgets that expect to be "bound" should implement this trait and return themselves.
/// Widgets that wrap another widget and do not provide anything likely to need binding should
/// recurse and call the same method on their inner widget.
///
/// This scheme isn't perfect as it stops at the first Bindable in all cases. However it covers the common case of
/// binding something that is already lensed.
